# Arabic Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is an Arabic Sentiment Analysis system designed to interpret and classify emotions from Arabic text data on social media, specifically focusing on the unique complexities of the Arabic language.

## Features
- Sentiment classification into positive, negative, and neutral categories.
- High accuracy and performance metrics (90.11% accuracy, 90.90% precision, 90.11% recall, 90.32% F1 score).
- Utilization of a dataset consisting of 23,500 tweets from Saudi Arabia.

## Technical Details
- Machine Learning model development with Neural Networks.
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction for Arabic script.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and then set up your environment using the following commands:
```bash
pip install jupyter==1.0.0 keras==2.6.0 Keras-Preprocessing==1.1.2 matplotlib==3.5.1 nltk==3.6.5 numpy==1.19.5 pandas==1.3.5 scikit-learn==1.0.1 seaborn==0.11.2 sklearn==0.0 snowballstemmer==2.0.0 tensorflow==2.6.0 wordcloud==1.8.1 python-bidi==0.4.2 arabic-reshaper==2.1.3
```
The `requirements.txt` file includes necessary libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, NLTK, and others.

## Requirements
Python libraries used in this project:
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development.
- Keras with TensorFlow backend for modeling.
- NLTK for natural language processing tasks.
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
